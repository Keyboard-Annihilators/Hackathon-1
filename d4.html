        <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that
          focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that
          typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception,
          speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for an
          AI interview:

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What is the Turing test, and how is it used to evaluate AI systems?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing, is a test of a machine's
          ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from
          a human. The test involves a human evaluator interacting with a
          machine and trying to determine if they are talking to a human or a
          machine.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the difference between narrow AI and general AI.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          Narrow AI (or weak AI) is designed to perform a specific task, such as
          playing chess or recognizing images. General AI (or strong AI) is
          designed to perform a wide range of tasks and have human-level
          intelligence across multiple domains.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is the role of machine learning in artificial intelligence?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          Machine learning is a key component of artificial intelligence, as it
          enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being
          explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are used to develop
          models that can make predictions or decisions based on data.

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer40')">
          40. What are the ethical concerns surrounding the development of
          artificial intelligence?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer40">
          Some of the key ethical concerns with AI include bias and
          discrimination, privacy and security, transparency and
          interpretability, and the potential for AI to displace human workers.
          Ethical considerations must be a priority in the development of
          artificial intelligence systems.
