        <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses
          statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn"
          from data, without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine
          learning is to create algorithms that can make predictions or
          decisions based on data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for a
          machine learning interview:

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised
          learning?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while
          unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          Bias refers to errors due to overly simplistic models, while variance
          refers to errors due to models being too complex. The tradeoff
          involves finding a balance to minimize total error.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is overfitting and how can you prevent it?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data.
          It can be prevented by using techniques such as cross-validation,
          pruning, regularization, and using more training data.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">
          4. What is the difference between classification and regression
          problems?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer4">
          Classification problems involve predicting discrete or categorical
          outputs, while regression problems involve predicting continuous
          outputs. The choice of model and evaluation metrics depends on the
          problem type.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">
          5. What are the main steps in a machine learning project?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer5">
          The main steps in a machine learning project are: problem definition,
          data collection and preprocessing, model selection and training, model
          evaluation, and model deployment.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer6')">
          6. Explain the concept of ensemble methods in machine learning.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer6">
          Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve the overall
          performance. Examples include bagging, boosting, and stacking, which
          can help reduce bias and variance compared to individual models.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">
          7. What is the purpose of feature engineering in machine learning?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer7">
          Feature engineering involves creating or selecting the most
          informative features from raw data to improve the performance of
          machine learning models. It's a crucial step in the machine learning
          pipeline.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer8')">
          8. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised
          dimensionality reduction techniques.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer8">
          Supervised techniques, like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), use
          labeled data to find the most discriminative features. Unsupervised
          techniques, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), find the most
          informative features without using labels.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer9')">
          9. What is the purpose of a confusion matrix in classification
          problems?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer9">
          A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the performance of
          a classification model, showing the number of true positives, true
          negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps in
          evaluating the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer10')">
          10. Explain the concept of transfer learning in machine learning.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer10">
          Transfer learning involves using a model trained on one task as a
          starting point for a model on a different but related task. This can
          be useful when you have limited data for the target task, as it allows
          you to leverage knowledge from a related domain.
