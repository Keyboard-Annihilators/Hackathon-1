        <h2>Introduction to C Programming</h2>
        <p>
          C is a low-level, general-purpose programming language that was
          developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is widely used for
          system programming, application development, and embedded systems.

          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for a C
          programming interview:

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What are the data types in C programming?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          The basic data types in C are: int, float, double, char, short, long,
          and void. C also supports derived data types such as arrays, pointers,
          structures, and unions.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the difference between a pointer and an array in C.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another
          variable, while an array is a collection of elements of the same data
          type stored in contiguous memory locations.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is the purpose of the malloc() function in C?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          The malloc() function is used to dynamically allocate a block of
          memory in the heap. It returns a pointer to the allocated memory,
          which can be used to store data at runtime.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer40')">
          40. Explain the concept of function pointers in C.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer40">
          Function pointers in C are pointers that can hold the address of a
          function. They can be used to pass functions as arguments to other
          functions, create callback functions, and implement function tables.
