        <h2>Introduction to Data Science</h2>
        <p>
          Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics,
          mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to
          extract insights and knowledge from data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for a
          Data Science interview:
        </p>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What is the difference between structured, semi-structured, and
          unstructured data?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          Structured data is data that follows a predefined schema and can be
          easily stored and queried in a relational database. Semi-structured
          data, like XML or JSON, has some structure but is more flexible.
          Unstructured data, such as text or images, does not have a pre-defined
          format.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the purpose of data cleaning and preprocessing in data
          science.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          Data cleaning and preprocessing involve tasks like handling missing
          values, removing duplicates, transforming data, and performing feature
          engineering. This is a crucial step in the data science process, as it
          ensures the data is of high quality and suitable for analysis.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is the difference between descriptive, predictive, and
          prescriptive analytics?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing and describing the
          current or historical state of the data. Predictive analytics uses
          models to forecast future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics provides
          recommendations on the best course of action to achieve desired
          outcomes.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">
          4. Explain the importance of data visualization in data science.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer4">
          Data visualization is crucial for data scientists to effectively
          communicate insights and findings to stakeholders. By presenting data
          in visual formats, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, data
          scientists can help decision-makers understand complex information and
          patterns more easily.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">
          5. What is the role of domain knowledge in data science projects?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer5">
          Domain knowledge is essential for data scientists to understand the
          context and business requirements of a problem, ask the right
          questions, and interpret the findings in a meaningful way. Effective
          data science projects often require close collaboration between data
          scientists and subject matter experts.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer6')">
          6. Explain the concept of data pipelines in data science.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer6">
          Data pipelines are a series of data processing steps, often automated,
          that ingest, transform, and load data from various sources into a
          target system or data store. Well-designed pipelines ensure
          consistent, reliable, and scalable data processing for data science
          and analytics applications.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">
          7. What is the purpose of A/B testing in data science?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer7">
          A/B testing is a method for comparing two or more versions of a
          product, feature, or marketing campaign to determine which one
          performs better. It is a powerful tool for data scientists to validate
          hypotheses and make data-driven decisions.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer8')">
          8. Explain the concept of feature engineering in data science.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer8">
          Feature engineering is the process of creating or selecting the most
          informative features from raw data to improve the performance of
          machine learning models. It involves tasks like data transformation,
          selection, and creation to extract the most relevant information from
          the data.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer9')">
          9. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
          in the context of data science?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer9">
          Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data to make
          predictions or classifications, while unsupervised learning involves
          finding patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Supervised learning
          is often used for predictive modeling, while unsupervised learning is
          useful for exploratory data analysis and clustering.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer10')">
          10. Explain the importance of data ethics and privacy in data science.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer10">
          Data scientists must ensure that data is collected, processed, and
          used in an ethical and responsible manner, respecting individual
          privacy and adhering to relevant regulations and guidelines. This
          includes considerations around data privacy, bias, and the potential
          societal impact of data-driven insights and decisions.
