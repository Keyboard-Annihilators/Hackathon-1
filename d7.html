        <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
        <p>
          Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed
          by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is widely used for
          building a variety of applications, from desktop applications to
          mobile apps and enterprise-level software.

          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for a
          Java programming interview:

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What are the key features of Java?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          Key features of Java include: object-oriented programming, platform
          independence (write once, run anywhere), automatic memory management
          (garbage collection), strong type checking, and a rich standard
          library.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract (concrete)
          methods, and they can have instance variables. Interfaces, on the
          other hand, can only have abstract methods and constant variables.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          The final keyword in Java can be used to: 1) declare a constant
          variable that cannot be reassigned, 2) prevent a class from being
          extended, and 3) prevent a method from being overridden in subclasses.
        </div>

        <!-- Add more questions in the same format -->

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer40')">
          40. Explain the concept of exception handling in Java.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer40">
          Exception handling in Java allows you to write code that can handle
          unexpected events or errors gracefully, instead of causing the program
          to crash. Java has built-in exception classes, and you can also create
          custom exception classes.
