        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This website covers a range of questions that are commonly asked
          during technical aptitude and HR interviews. These questions are
          designed to assess your problem-solving skills, critical thinking
          abilities, and personality traits.

        <h2>Technical Aptitude Questions</h2>
        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What is the difference between RAM and ROM?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          RAM (Random Access Memory) is a volatile memory that can be read from
          and written to, while ROM (Read-Only Memory) is a non-volatile memory
          that can only be read from. RAM is used for temporary data storage,
          while ROM is used for storing permanent data like BIOS.

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the purpose of a circuit breaker.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          A circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that automatically
          interrupts the flow of electricity in a circuit when it detects a
          fault or an overload. This helps to protect electrical equipment and
          prevent potential fires or other hazards.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol
          that ensures reliable data transfer, while UDP (User Datagram
          Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that does not guarantee
          reliable data delivery. TCP is more suitable for applications that
          require error-free data transfer, while UDP is better for real-time
          applications that can tolerate some data loss.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">
          4. Explain the concept of binary search.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer4">
          Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to find the
          position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by
          repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value
          is found or the search space is exhausted. Binary search is more
          efficient than linear search for sorted arrays.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">
          5. What is the purpose of an operating system?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer5">
          An operating system is the software that manages the hardware
          resources of a computer and provides a platform for running
          applications. It handles tasks such as memory management, process
          scheduling, file management, and input/output operations, making it
          easier for users and programs to interact with the computer.
