        <h2>Introduction to Data Structures</h2>
        <p>
          Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of any computer
          program. They are used to organize and store data in a way that makes
          it efficient to access, modify, and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for a
          data structures interview:

          1. What is an array and what are its time complexities?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in
          contiguous memory locations. The time complexities for common array
          operations are: Accessing an element - O(1), Inserting/Deleting at the
          end - O(1), Inserting/Deleting at the beginning/middle - O(n).
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements
          are added and removed from the top. A queue is a First-In-First-Out
          (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added at the rear and
          removed from the front.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is a linked list and what are its time complexities?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains data
          and a reference to the next node. The time complexities for common
          linked list operations are: Accessing an element - O(n), Inserting/
          Deleting at the beginning - O(1), Inserting/Deleting at the end -
          O(n).
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer40')">
          40. Explain the purpose and implementation of a binary search tree.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer40">
          A binary search tree is a tree-based data structure where each node
          has at most two child nodes. The left child is less than the parent,
          and the right child is greater than the parent. This structure allows
          for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
