        <h2>Introduction to Python Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its
          simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used in various
          domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning,
          and automation.

          Here are some common questions and answers to help you prepare for a
          Python programming interview:

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
          1. What are the key features of Python?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          Python's key features include: interpreted language, dynamic typing,
          high-level language, open-source, cross-platform compatibility,
          object-oriented programming, extensive standard library, and large
          community support.

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
          2. Explain the concept of list comprehension in Python.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list from an
          existing list or iterable. It allows you to perform operations on each
          element and add it to the new list in a single line of code.
        </div>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
          3. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
          The main differences are: lists are mutable (can be modified), while
          tuples are immutable (cannot be modified); lists are defined using
          square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses ().

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer40')">
          40. Explain the concept of decorators in Python.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer40">
          Decorators in Python are a way to modify the behavior of a function
          without changing its source code. They are defined using the @ symbol
          and can be used to add functionality, logging, caching, and more to a
          function.
